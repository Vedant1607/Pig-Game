# Pig Game

A simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📝 Description
Pig Game is a turn-based game where two players compete to reach a target score first. Players roll a dice to accumulate points but risk losing their current round score if they roll a `1`.

## 🎮 How to Play

2. Click `🎲 Roll dice` to roll a dice:
   - If the dice shows `1`, the turn switches to the other player.
   - Otherwise, the number is added to the current score.
3. Click `📥 Hold` to save the accumulated points to the player's total score and pass the turn.
4. The first player to reach 20 points wins the game!
5. Click `🔄 New game` to restart the game.
